# Changelog

## 1.1.0

* Copy button under each reply of the AI (copies the text, shows a check for a moment), as in the ORYKSA apps and extension.
* Voice: a voice screen with the photo of the AI ("I'm listening" / her answer, Mute, Close) opened from the microphone in the chat. The same behaviour as the ORYKSA app: the microphone stays open while she speaks and only a human voice cuts her off (typing, TV, birds and her own echo do not); she stops on the word and the text stays in the chat; the second before the cut is kept; 700 ms of silence closes a sentence (15 s at most); a whisper gets a whispered, shorter answer; her voice is the one chosen in ORYKSA and, if it fails, the text is shown without a robot voice.
* The voice engine is the ORYKSA app engine (`Vad`), with the same audio tests on real recordings.
* `appContext`: tell the AI which screen of your app the customer is on (product, cart, booking) so it answers about it.
* The client gets `tts`, `transcribe` and `voiceStats`; `send` accepts `voice`, `whisper`, `appContext` and returns `speech` (the short spoken version).
* The agent includes `photo` (the AI photo from Your AI), `voice` and `language`.
* Bold text (`**`) in the chat bubbles.
* The SDK serves the customers of the business only: it is never an interface for the owner.
* Voice on iOS (AVAudioEngine, voice chat session). Add `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` to Info.plist.

## 1.0.0

* First release.
* `OryksaClient`: in-app client with short-lived session tokens (agent, send, sendAndWait, messages), refreshes the token when it expires.
* `OryksaChatButton`, `OryksaChatView` (SwiftUI) and `OryksaChatViewController` (UIKit): ready chat with the look of the ORYKSA website chat, name and photo of the AI from the ORYKSA account, in English, Portuguese (Portugal and Brazil) and Spanish.
* Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods.
